== Description ==


## Problem Statement
When we create a new user in wordpress. Wordpress send a link to added user's email. There is no provision to send password by default.

## Solution Statement
This plugin will generate a random password and sends to their email.

## What is not possible
If you want to send your added password on user's email. This is not possible because wordpress use MD5 (one way encryption technique).

So nobody can decrypt that and send your added password while you have created user.
